2 dice piggy game 
[["Player 1" total_score round_score ]
 ["Player 2" total_score round_score ]
 ...
 ["Player n" total_score round_score ]]
 
Rules
* Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
* If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
* If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
* If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)
